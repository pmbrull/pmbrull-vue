              As a Mathematician, everything is a puzzle! And working with data we have

          Finally, I am really curious and passionate about learning. I enjoy looking for new and elegant ways
          to achieve whatever I am working on, both at work and at home. <em>Let's push it to the limit! 
          Have we tried that? </em>

          With this blog I'll try to keep my head and ideas organized, while also being able to give back
          to the internet community a bit of content just in return for the thousands of hours spent in Stack Overflow!

         Regarding the blog itself... I started playing around with blogs around 2018.
         I started with a simple Jekyll theme hosted in Github pages, but it lacked the freedom
         I wanted to achieve. By then I was really in love with Scala - I still am - so I
         switched to Play Framework just pour le fun. I was happy with the result but I did not
         integrate any markdown in it as I wanted to mess with ScalaJS. In the end, writing
         was a bit cumbersome, so I thought about another change. I played a bit with a 47 Degree's
         project called microsites, which was really fast to spin up. But again, it did not
         offer much flexibility.

         Now, I just wanted to do something that i'd like the look and feel but that would
         be easy to push me to write new content. Therefore, I went directly to Javascript with
         VueJS and a Markdown plugin.

         I am no frontend developer, and it was not easy to get to this point, but it was indeed
         really fun. I hope you enjoy this as much as I did during all these years! üòç
