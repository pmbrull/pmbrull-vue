title: Studying for Azure Certifications
published: true

    I've recently obtained one Azure Certification, and boy
    it was a rough ride. Sometimes it's not only preparing for
    an exam, but not knowing how the exam is going to be, and this
    feeling only grows when you have not taken an online
    exam before.

Therefore, today I'd like to share my experience when studying and taking the [AZ-203](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-203) certification exam.

The path I followed was based on watching some videos on Udemy. While they were useful, that was just up to some point. I found it hard to expand the material based on just small pieces of information and in the end, the theory required was much wider than what was presented there.

What I found to be really valuable are the Microsoft's Learning Paths, which you can follow at your own pace. Those are tightly linked to the actual services documentation, so if you add the labs they provide on top, you end up with an overall strong knowledge.

## Scheduling the Exam

What I failed to do correctly was scheduling the exam date. I was rushed in the last days and at the time of scheduling there were not that much free slots. This means that I registered on Friday at 8pm for the day after at 7:30am. My advise here is to plan your study for a fixed appointment, and get your slot beforehand.

Another question that was bugging me was *how* the d-day was going to be. Putting names and faces into things makes them less scary, so there we go:

* Keep the room where you are taking the exam free of clutter. Just you and the computer should be there.
* You are going to run a test on your machine that will check both camera and microphone.
* An employee of the exam hosting company will reach out to you via chat. You will need to show the room to make sure that everything is as expected.

And that's it! Not that bad, right? Finally, a special browser will open, so you only have access to the exam and nothing else in the computer. Micro and camera are kept on, as they are monitoring both video and sound.

## Fundamentals

In order to prepare for any certification, I am always trying to get the fundamentals right. In this case it was really easy, as I could use the material for another certification: [AZ-900](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-fundamentals) called Azure Fundamentals.

Although I did not take that exam, I have some notes based on the Microsoft's docs that were really useful to me to wrap up all the information.

You can find them on my [Github](https://github.com/pmbrull/azure-fundamentals-notes)
