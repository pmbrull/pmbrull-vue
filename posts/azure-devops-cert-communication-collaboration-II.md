  DevOps is a culture that not only affects
  how we develop and deliver software, but is
  also linked to how we plan our work, define
  objectives, measure them and pivot when noticing
  that we are not creating value.

## Introduce the foundation pillars of DevOps: Culture and Lean Product

Learning Objectives:
* List the pillars, capabilities, and benefits of DevOps.
* Describe two DevOps pillars, Culture and Lean Product Management.

## Discover DevOps

**DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users.**

We can define four pillars of DevOps based on People, Process and Product: Culture, Lean Process, Architecture and Technology.

Then, there are eight functions or capabilities: Continuous Planning, Integration, Delivery, Operations, Quality, Security, Collaboration and Improvement.

This results in deploying more code, more frequently, with safer results and easier to recover.

### Explore DevOps Culture

Culture is an essential foundation, because DevOps requires a growth and continuous learning mindset to succeed. Leadership support is one of the critical elements to its success.

It defines:
* What is acceptable or unacceptable.
* What is important or unimportant.
* What is right or wrong.
* What is workable or unworkable.
* Who you hire, fire, and promote.

The primary responsibility of leadership is the creation of an environment that enables a successful DevOps culture. Without culture, devops enabling fails.

### The 12 examples of a DevOps mindset

* **Leadership mindset**: identify, transform and empower transformational leaders.
* **Customer-focused mindset**: listen, learn and measure what is important.
* **Lean-thinking mindset**: understanding what value the customer assigns to product and services and create objectives that generate value. Anything else is waste.
* **System-thinking mindset**: emphasizes the performance of the entire system, not the performance of a specific silo of work or department.
* **Removing waste mindset**: Coming from the lean mindset.
* **Thinking theory of constraints**: methodology for identifying and removing constraints (also referred to as bottlenecks) that limit throughput. Remove whatever stops us achieving a goal.
* **Balancing alignment and autonomy mindsets**: To ensure innovation but also consistency.
* **Shift-left testing mindset**: The sooner we detect errors, the easier they are to repair.
* **Security mindset**: By promoting awareness, defining principles and living by them.
* **Hypothesis-driven development mindset**: Using a Lean Product approach to develop in shorter cycles and using hypothesis-driven development helps create small experiments to get feedback from our customers and data-driven decisions.
* **Live-site mindset**: Our goal is to give value to customers, so we need to go to PROD fast, but to also keep it healthy following best practices.
* **Measure outcome, not activity mindset**: measure usage, velocity and live site health, not lines of code, team burndown, and number of bugs found.

### Explore DevOps Lean Product

Great product companies have four things in common:

* Speed to market
* Agility when faced with change
* The move to digital business
* Customer satisfaction

"Product-mode" is a way of working. It is a way of funding and organizing software development that differs significantly from the projects way of doing it. Itâ€™s a continuous process of improvement of the product through the delivery of new features.

Generally, a product manager owns this product and is responsible for its ongoing development and its budget. This product may exist on a platform, which is essentially a product on which other products are built.

The product-centric model:

* Can serve external and internal customers
* Is clearly defined by its business capabilities
* Delivers capabilities that have customers value
* Can be a repeatable service or a platform
* Can be bought, sold, subscribed. and/or funded
* Has competition in the market and a product lifecycle

We talk about product - not project - because products evolve over time. They also need multidisciplinary teams (not deep specialization) to support the product end-to-end.
