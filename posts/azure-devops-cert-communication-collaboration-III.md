## Characterize DevOps Continuous Collaboration and Continuous Improvement

Learning Objectives:
* List the five dysfunctions of a team.
* Explain how Continuous Collaboration supports the cultural shifts that are key to any DevOps journey.
* Describe the metrics for Continuous Improvement.
* Explain the role of value stream mapping in Continuous Improvement.

## Explore Continuous Collaboration

Communication challenges affect the ability to resolve an incident. **MTTR**, or **mean time to resolution** is a measurement of the average amount of time from when an issue is detected until it has been completely fixed. Reducing MTTR is an important KPI, but it hard to reduce without proper collaboration.

There are 5 Dysfunctions identified of a team:

* **Absence of trust**
* **Fear of conflict**
* **Lack of commitment**
* **Avoidance of accountability**
* **Inattention to results**: Teams that trust one another, engage in conflict, commit to decisions, and hold one another accountable are very likely to set aside their individual needs and agendas and focus almost exclusively on what is best for the team.

### What is Continuous Collaboration?

Continuous Collaboration is a practice that supports the cultural shifts that are key to any DevOps journey. It enables teams to innovate outside of the boundaries of planned meetings, and fosters innovation within the team by creating an integrated experience.

Culture and cross-functional collaboration have many beneficial impacts on performance, including:

* Different perspectives, which can spur innovation
* Buy-in and trust, which can help increase the momentum of change
* Knowledge gets cross-pollinated, and everyone learns more
* The challenging of old ideas
* Leveling the playing field

## Explore Continuous Improvement

Continuous Improvement involves and requires measurement. How do you identify improvement if you don't measure?

### What is Continuous Improvement?

Continuously and candidly observing your DevOps process allows teams to identify possible improvement points.

All improvement requires change, but not all change is improvement. This is why measurement is a critical success factor to organizations using DevOps. It is important to create feedback loops to get measurements on features and see if they have the expected effect.

### Measurement and metrics

The four most important measures of software delivery performance are:

* **Lead time for change**: The time it takes for a bug fix, new feature, or any other change to go from idea to deployment to production.
* **Deployment frequency**: A direct or indirect measure of response time, team cohesiveness, developer capabilities, development tool effectiveness, and overall DevOps team efficiency.
* **Mean time to restore**: How long it generally takes to restore a primary app or service when a service incident occurs.
* **Change fail percentage**: The percentage of changes to production that fail.

It’s the responsibility of DevOps leadership to measure things like operational health metrics, usage, velocity, and live site health. In other words, measure IMPACT, not ACTIVITY. A metric is only useful if it is actionable.

### Continuous feedback

Lean startups have established an optimal path to getting ideas developed, delivered, and refined – by creating an incredible positive continuous feedback culture:

* Release early, release often
* Start with a minimum viable product
* Use hypothesis-driven development
* Continuous improvement through customer feedback

### Continuous Improvement through value stream mapping

A value stream is a sequence of activities an organization undertakes to deliver on a customer request. Value stream mapping is a highly effective way to learn to see and resolve disconnects, redundancies, and gaps in how work gets done (i.e., helps to identify and quantify waste). It also allows you to break down the delivery process and measure lead time, cycle time, and idle time, which helps teams make data-based adjustments to the workflow.
