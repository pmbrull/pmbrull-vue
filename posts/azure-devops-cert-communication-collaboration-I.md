## Analyze DevOps Continuous Planning and Continuous Integration 

Learning objectives:
* Describe Objectives and Key Results.
* Compare Continuous and Static Planning.
* Describe the six principles of Continuous Planning.
* Characterize Continuous Integration.
* Analyze the effects of Continuous integration on performance.

## Explore Continuous Planning

What continuous planning tries to handle is the huge difficulty that means to plan anything upfront. The higher the time required, the harder it gets to be on point.

**Objectives & Key Results (OKRs)** is a goal-setting framework designed to connect strategic goals set by leadership with the day-to-day activities of execution teams. OKRs help identify the best possible result and create clarity around what real success looks like.

There are three essential aspects of OKRs:

* They make up a **framework** for defining clear objectives, providing clarity on the intent and direction at all levels in the organization.
* They're reinforced with measurable key results, which are a measure of success.
* They drive an outcome mindset culture, enabling a clear shift from an output mindset to an outcome mindset.

There are five key benefits of OKRs:

* **Focus**: every objective should fit on one line. As for key results, you should have no more than five per objective.
* **Alignment**: to the organizationâ€™s company-wide vision.
* **Commitment**: to schedules and resources.
* **Tracking**: Every OKR should be able to be tracked via the metrics established when they were written.
* **Stretching**: Push organizations to strive further.

### Compare Continuous and Static Planning

In Static Planning we talk about the "Traditional Iron Triangle", where the scope is fixed at the beginning of the project and then duration & cost and quality can (and will) vary over time. Instead, in Continuous planning there is an agile team that follows the triangle of "Agile Best Practices", where duration & cost and quality are fixed values, while the scope can vary depending on how the project develops.

There are four things to keep in mind:

* Business needs constantly change and do so on short notice
* Agile has the planning mechanisms to keep up with business changes
* High-performing teams can as easily go quickly in the wrong direction.
* Gaining knowledge reduces risk.

### Explore the six principles of Continuous Planning

1. Value simplicity
1. The manifesto for agile software development: Software development lies at the center. It defines the interaction of developers with their tools, the value of working software, customer collaboration and being able to respond to change.
2. Design thinking: human-centered approach to innovation focusing on the intersection of viability, feasibility, and desirability to establish boundaries and reduce waste (often working in an early MVP).
3. Iterative and incremental development: putting requirements and prioritization into the hands of the stakeholders in an iterative feedback loop.
4. Lean management: Value is defined from the standpoint of the end customer. In the process, value streams are identified and steps where value isn't delivered to the customer are identified as waste and removed.
5. Estimation accuracy: Estimates are owned by the engineering team and Targets are owned by the business. A commitment is a promise to deliver functionality and quality by a certain date. Commitments are owned jointly.

### Explain the relationship between OKR and Scrum

OKRs are the definition of Key Results based on each objective. With Scrum, we then define Epics, User stories, features, tasks...

## Analyze Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration is a mindset and a team strategy, where team members integrate periodically their work. Each integration is then verified by an automated build to detect errors as soon as possible.


The goals of Continuous Integration are to:

* Harness collaboration
* Enable parallel development
* Minimize integration debt
* Act as a quality gate
* Automate everything!
